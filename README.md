## Fizzbuzz in Java

I have used some simple exercises to learn some Java and have built a simple FizzBuzz game. 

Next up I will use JUnit to TDD a new iteration of fizzbuzz. 

### Learnt so far

- Numbers
- strings
- arrays
- importing from utils
- ArrayList and Iterator
- using scanner to get User input
